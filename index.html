            So how much does it really cost?
            <br><br>
            UDWD keeps it simple.
            <br><br>
            The cost is 420rs for the first 10kms and 10rs per km after that.
            <br><br>
            An additional cost will apply if you go through any tolls.
            <br><br>
            Waiting time will apply if we are waiting longer than 10 minutes at the cost of 70rs per minute.
            <br><br>
            Out of area pickups range from 70rs to 350rs above the normal charge depending on how far you are outside our area.
            <br><br>
            All credit card payments occur a 3% surcharge.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            Please remember to book early on these days so you don’t miss out on a pick up.
            <br><br>
            A Cancellation Fee will be charged if you cancel your booking within 2 hours of the pickup time. The charge is the cost of the job. The same will apply if you don’t show up at the pick up location.

            A little about who we are
            and why we started. <br><br>
            UDWD commenced in 2006 when its owners recognised a need to promote responsibility and keep drunk drivers off the road. As seen on the news there are simply way too many deaths and accidents caused by drink driving. Our aim is to reduce this number by driving people home safely in their own car for a very reasonable cost. <br><br>
            The service is based on sending two drivers to the client after a night out. One driver will drive the client home in their own car and the other will follow in their own car. Friends and family can benefit too, as the service provides multiple drops offs on route to the final location.<br><br>
            The service is available 7 days per week.<br><br>
            The service has grown successfully since we have started, and in 2010 partnered with NRMA’s More4Members program. NRMA recognised the benefits this service offered to its members. Click on the NRMA logo to see more.<br><br>
            UDWD provides its clients with convenience, a positive social image and a worry free night of entertainment, knowing that they and their cars will get home safely.

            <b>What we can do for you?</b>
            <br><br>
            UDWD operates 7 days per week, from 12pm to 12am on Sunday to Thursday and 12pm to 2:30am on Friday and Saturday. Please note, bookings close 1 hour prior to close time, as we always need 1 hour notice to get you.
            <br>
            UDWD is currently operating only in ludhiana at the moment , but with steady growth shown here in ludhiana we will be expanding into other areas of Australia soon.
            <br>
            UDWD also operates on Christmas Day (4pm to 10pm) and New Years Eve (12pm till late). Just remember that New Years Eve requires a lot of patience with traffic caused by road closures all around ludhiana. No pick ups will be made in the city centre between 11:30pm and 1am as it is almost impossible to get in there by car.
            <br>
            If you require a pickup that is out of our area, then an out of area charge will apply. It all depends on how far you are outside the area for how much we charge, it is capped at 350rs above the normal charge.
            <br><br><br>
              <b> How does it work? </b>
            <br>
            UDWD drivers are available on call or with an advanced Booking.
            <br>
            Bookings are preferable and can be made by phone on 9915611761
            <br>
            When making your Booking we will ask for the following information:
            <br>
            Your Name<br>
            The time and location of pick up<br>
            The drop off location<br>
            Any additional drop offs<br>
            Number of people in your party<br>
            Vehicle make/registration<br>
            Your Credit Card number<br>
            <br><br>
            UDWD will give you an estimated time of arrival (based on driver availability) and dispatch a team of professional drivers to your location.
            <br>
            Your UDWD drivers will call you 15 to 20 minutes before your pick up time and once they have arrived at your location so please have your phone handy. One driver will drive you home in your car and the other will follow in their own car.
            <br>
            Once at your destination the UDWD driver will park your vehicle at your specified location, lock it and hand you the keys. Home safely.
            <br>
            The cost will be calculated using your odometer and your driver will tell you how much you owe for the ride and any additional fees (e.g. Tolls, etc). Payment can be made using Visa, MasterCard, AMEX or good old fashioned cash.
            <br>
            Tips are not mandatory, but appreciated.
